# nuclide

A CSS framework for utilizing the Atomic design pattern

### Summary

nuclide is a Sass-based CSS framework that attempts to follow Atomic CSS design
conventions.

Its emphasis is simplicity: it will not include fancy modals, form validation
elements, and so on; leave those things to frameworks and libraries like
Bootstrap and Foundation. nuclide offers a generalized set of classes to make
quickly building rock-solid layouts a breeze, without bogging you down too much
with the fancy widgets other libraries offer.

nuclide will eventually contain both atomic and molecular units:

- **atoms**, for providing individual styles with which you can compose elements
- **molecules**, for providing pre-determined combinations of atoms, representing commonly-used sets of styles

### How to use

The source for nuclide is implemented in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

Assuming you have Sass installed via Rubygems, either compile the source Sass:

```
sass src/main.scss dest/style.css
```

or use the `watch` directive from the command line:

```
sass --watch src/main.scss:dest/style.css
```

Alternatively, you can grab the compiled `style.css` in the `dest` directory and
replace any unit values manually.

Don't forget to add a [normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and
[grid](http://responsive.gs/), also!

### Inspiration and sources

- Class names and styles from the [Emmet toolkit](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)
- Basis for other styles from [nemophrost's atomic-css project](https://github.com/nemophrost/atomic-css)
