# nuclide

A CSS framework for utilizing the Atomic design pattern

### How to use

The source for nuclide is implemented in Sass.

Assuming you have Sass installed via Rubygems, either compile the source Sass:

```
sass src/main.scss dest/style.css
```

or use the `watch` directive from the command line:

```
sass --watch src/main.scss:dest/style.css
```

Alternatively, you can grab the compiled `style.css` in the `dest` directory and
replace any unit values manually.
